          Traveling is my favorite pastime. I lived abroad until I was 13 years old, mainly in Brazil and Ecuador, which allowed me to develop my culture and my open-mindedness and it also allowed me to meet many people. I have also travelled a lot in other countries and would like to continue to discover new countries, new cultures and meet new people.

          I am a fairly athletic person having practiced many different sports. Sport is essential for me and helps me to stay fit. It allows me to stay in shape, it is also a way to evacuate and clear my mind.
